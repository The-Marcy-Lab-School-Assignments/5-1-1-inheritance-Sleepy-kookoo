# Question
What's the difference between an `instance` method and a `class` method?

# Answer
The difference between instance method is like actions specific to each individual object (like each person doing something unique), and a class method is like instructions or rules that apply to all objects made from the same blueprint (like rules all people follow)..

Yes, and if we mean it literally, an class method requires the `static` keyword in front of it while an instance does not. In addition, we would need to first create an instance to use an instance method whereas a class method can be accessed from the class directly!
