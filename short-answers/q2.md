# Question
In a code snippet, demonstrate inheritance by creating two classes where one is the parent class and one is the child class.

In your code example, create an instance of the child class and reference/invoke a property/method of the parent class.

# Answer
```js
// Parent class
class Doctor {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`My name is ${this.name}. I am your doctor for this appointment.`);
  }
}

// Child class inheriting from Animal
class Appointment extends Doctor {
  constructor(name, time) {
    super(name); // Call the parent constructor with the 'name' parameter
    this.time = time;
  }

  reminder() {
    console.log(`Hi ${this.name}. Your appointment is at ${this.time}!`);
  }
}

// Creating an instance of the child class
let appointment = new Appointment('Sara', '10:30');

// Invoking a method of the parent class through the child instance
appointment.reminder(); // 

```

# Teacher Feedback

I think you may have confused a couple of topics! 
Things you did well: 
- Created 2 classes
- There is a parent class and a subclass, you used the keyword extends to show this!
- Created an instance!

Things that could be improved: 
- These two classes, more than anything represent a one to many relationship or a has many/belongs to relationship.
- An example that could have worked is Person(parent class/superclass) -> Doctor(subclass/child class) because this clearly shows a doctor as a special type of person!
- Another example that could have worked as well is Appointment(parent) -> DoctorAppointment(child) because a doctor appointment is a type of appointment!
-In your example you invoke a method that is already on the child but the prompt asked to show inheritance by invoking a method from the parent class! You could have invoked `speak()` instead!
