# Question
In a code snippet, demonstrate inheritance by creating two classes where one is the parent class and one is the child class.

In your code example, create an instance of the child class and reference/invoke a property/method of the parent class.

# Answer
```js
// Parent class
class Doctor {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`My name is ${this.name}. I am your doctor for this appointment.`);
  }
}

// Child class inheriting from Animal
class Appointment extends Doctor {
  constructor(name, time) {
    super(name); // Call the parent constructor with the 'name' parameter
    this.time = time;
  }

  reminder() {
    console.log(`Hi ${this.name}. Your appointment is at ${this.time}!`);
  }
}

// Creating an instance of the child class
let appointment = new Appointment('Sara', '10:30');

// Invoking a method of the parent class through the child instance
appointment.reminder(); // 

```
