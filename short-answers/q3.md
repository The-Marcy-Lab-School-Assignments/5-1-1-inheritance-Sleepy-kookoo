# Question
What is polymorphism? Show an example in a code snippet.

# Answer
Polymorphism is like having different ways to do the same thing, depending on what you're working with. 
It use the same function or method name to do different things based on what kind of object or data we're dealing with
This makes coding more flexible and easier to understand, because you can reuse the same names for actions that make sense in different contexts. 

"Same name method different implementation"

```js
class Doctor {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`My name is ${this.name}. I am your doctor for this appointment.`);
  }
}

// Child class inheriting from Animal
class Appointment extends Doctor {
  constructor(name, time) {
    super(name); // Call the parent constructor with the 'name' parameter
    this.time = time;
  }
  speak(){
    /** FEEDBACK: You could use super in this way! However now when you invoke this method it would read as the following:
     * "My name is Sara, I am your doctor for this appointment. 
     * My name is Sara. I am your patient.
     * This works but probably not as you had planned! If you remove the invoked super method, this is still showing polymorphism since the name of the methods are the same but the implementation is different! 
     */
    super.speak() //is this how it works?
    console.log(`My name is ${this.name}. I am your patient.`)
  }

  reminder() {
    console.log(`Hi ${this.name}. Your appointment is at ${this.time}!`);
  }
}

// Creating an instance of the child class
let appointment = new Appointment('Sara', '10:30');

// Invoking a method of the parent class through the child instance
appointment.reminder(); // 
```
