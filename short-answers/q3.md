# Question
What is polymorphism? Show an example in a code snippet.

# Answer
Polymorphism is like having different ways to do the same thing, depending on what you're working with. 
It use the same function or method name to do different things based on what kind of object or data we're dealing with
This makes coding more flexible and easier to understand, because you can reuse the same names for actions that make sense in different contexts. 

"Same name method different implementation"

```js
class Doctor {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`My name is ${this.name}. I am your doctor for this appointment.`);
  }
}

// Child class inheriting from Animal
class Appointment extends Doctor {
  constructor(name, time) {
    super(name); // Call the parent constructor with the 'name' parameter
    this.time = time;
  }
  speak(){
    super.speak() //is this how it works?
    console.log(`My name is ${this.name}. I am your patient.`)
  }

  reminder() {
    console.log(`Hi ${this.name}. Your appointment is at ${this.time}!`);
  }
}

// Creating an instance of the child class
let appointment = new Appointment('Sara', '10:30');

// Invoking a method of the parent class through the child instance
appointment.reminder(); // 
```
